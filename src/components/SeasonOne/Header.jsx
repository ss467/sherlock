        <p id='info_descr'>Sherlock Holmes, an analytical deduction fanatic, is helping the police out with their enquiries for fun, when he runs into potential flatmate Dr John Watson, fresh from serving in the war in Afghanistan and sporting a limp. In spite of Watson's initial scepticism, Holmes' brilliant mind and dangerous lifestyle offer the stimulation he craves, and the two quickly forge an alliance.</p>
